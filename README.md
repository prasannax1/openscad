### Description

The *Exodus Class* is meant to act as both a deep space explorer, and as a mobile starbase to launch other exploration missions from. It is designed primarily for scientific missions, but like any ship designed after Wolf 359 and The Dominion War, it can also be used in military conflicts.

### Structure

The *Exodus* is an amalgamation of several smaller ships which can operate independently but normally link up to join the Exodus. Multi-vector mode is a nice idea for smaller ships - but for a ship that's about a mile long it's impossible to build without.

#### Aviary Class

![Saucer Section](images/mothership/saucer.png)

*Aviary Class* Mobile starbase/Heavy Carrier

##### Stats

 * Length: 746m
 * Width: 746m
 * Height: 90m
 * Decks: 27
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum (skeleton): 5
   * Minimum (sustainable): 50

   * *Bumblebee* class light shuttles
 * Warp speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 1.2
   * Maximum: Warp 1.6

   
At 750m long, the Aviary class is one of the largest ships in the Starfleet inventory. It's built almost entirely primary hull, with the engine sections and warp nacelles integrated into the saucer body.

The saucer is divided into 16 sections, with the aft 3 sections fused together to form the main engineering part of the *Aviary* class. Each of the remaining sections is split up into the upper 12 decks consisting of various labs, residential areas and special purpose rooms, the next 6 decks containing a large hangar, and the bottom 6 decks consist of security barracks, firing range, brigs etc.

Each section contains an auxillary sickbay, a brig, and a mess hall. They contain residences for the crew of all the ships in the hangar underneath, as well as residences for everyone who works in that sections. 8 of the sections contain secondary computer cores.

#### Mjolnir Class

![Transwarp](images/mothership/transwarp.png)

*Mjolnir class* Multimission Deep Space Explorer/ Heavy Experimental vessel/ Carrier

##### Stats

 * Length: 1147m
 * Width: 669m
 * Height: 205m
 * Decks: 40
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum (skeleton): 5
   * Minimum (sustainable): 100
   * Typical: 400
   * Maximum (all stations filled): 900
   * Maximum (evacuation limit): 10000
 * Auxillary Craft
   * *Vulture* class patrol vessels
   * *Eagle* class light scouts
   * *Dove* class diplomatic yachts
   * *Defiant* Class escort vessels
   * *Nova* Class science vessels
   * Small starship under 200m long and under 40m high
 * Warp speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 8
   * Maximum: Warp 9
   * Transwarp

At more than a kilometer long, the Mjolnir is so big that you can't believe it's meant to operate as only part of a starship. And indeed, the Mjolnir is by itself a complete multimission explorer that can compete with the Galaxy or a Sovereign Class.

In contrast with the *Aviary* class, the *Mjolnir* is almost entirely secondary hull, with the main saucer fused into the engineering section. The aft part of the upper hull is a massive hangar which can hold anything from several fighter craft, to a squadron of light escort vessels like the Vulture Class, to even a Defiant or a Nova class and equivalents.

The aft half of the ship is composed of the two massive warp coils of the ship. Like the *Excelsior* a century ago, the *Mjolnir* is meant to the the testbed of experimental propulsion.

#### Photon Class

![Command](images/mothership/command.png)

[View 3D](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/command.stl)

*Photon Class* heavy cruiser/ multimission explorer

#### Stats

 * Length: 445m
 * Width: 179m
 * Height: 65m 
 * Decks: 20 
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum (skeleton): 10
   * Minimum (sustainable): 10
   * Typical: 200
   * Maximum (all stations filled): 500
   * Maximum (evacuation limit): 5000
 * Auxillary Craft
   * *Magpie* class runabouts
   * *Hawk* class tactical runabouts
   * *Hornet* class heavy shuttles
   * *Dragonfly* class warp tugs
   * *Dove* class diplomatic yachts
   * *Bumblebee* class light shuttles
 * Warp speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 6
   * Maximum: Warp 9.7

Ostensibly the *Photon* class is just the command section of the *Exodus* assembly. But The *Photon* class is a heavy cruiser comparable to the Excelsior in size and function.

The *Photon* class has a variable geometry structure - The saucer section rises up by about 20m to allow the Photon to slide back from it's snug harness on top of the Aviary.

Like the Excelsior, the *Photon* class is used in mainly two ways:
 * As a control ship - the Photon class captures and "holds" a part of space during tactical operations. This is helped by the multi-phaser array that the Photon class has and the two shuttlebays which can hold several fighter craft
 * As a flagship - the bridge of the Photon Class is also the main bridge of the Exodus class when fully assembled. When disassembled, the Photon class is the flagship of the Exodus mini-fleet.

 * Auxillary Craft
   * *Bumblebee* class light shuttles
 * Warp speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 6
   * Maximum: Warp 9.7

The *Eager* class lives where you would expect a diplomatic yacht. It's used as a diplomatic vehicle by the *Exodus* but it's a full fledged general purpose light cruiser.

#### Bat Class

![Escort](images/mothership/escort.png)

Under the secondary hull/*Mjolnir* class lies the Bat class which is a dedicated escort vessel for the *Exodus*.

But at 400m long, it's a full size destroyer comparable to the *Prometheus* class

##### Image showing launch of Bat class from Exodus

![Escort Separation](images/mothership/escort-separation.png)

### Saucer separation

The *Exodus* class has two modes of saucer separation

#### Normal mode

![Normal Separation](images/mothership/normal-separation.png)


This is similar to the saucer separation of other large starship. The ship separates into two sections
 - The Saucer section with the *Aviary*, *Photon* and *Eager* parts
 - The engineering section which is just the *Mjolnir* and *Bat* class
 
#### Battle Mode

![Battle Separation](images/mothership/battle-separation.png)


Here the *Photon* class remains with the secondary hull, making the two sections as
 - The saucer section with the *Aviary* and *Eager* classes
 - The Battle section with the *Mjolnir*, *Bat* and the *Photon* classes
 
Even if both the *Mjolnir* and *Photon* classes are classified as general purpose explorers, the combination of the two makes for a formidable battle cruiser:

![Battle Cruiser](images/mothership/transwarp-full.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/transwarp-full.stl)

### Multi vector mode

![Full Separation](images/mothership/full-separation.png)


The *Exodus* class also has the multivector mode where all the component ships separate. This is generally the default mode in battle.

One of the drawbacks of early multivector ships was that if one of the middle vectors is destroyed or disabled, the whole ship is disabled because the extreme vectors cannot attach to each other. The *Exodus* doesn't have this problem as the *Photon* class can attach to both the *Aviary* and the *Mjolnir* classes.


## Auxillary craft

The *Exodus* is home to two separate families of auxillary craft.

# MACS

The Modular Auxillary Craft System (MACS) was conceived as a result of starships losing entirely too many shuttlecraft on away missions. The aims for the MACS program were two fold:
 1. Shuttlecraft should be harder to destroy
 2. Shuttlecraft should be easier to replace
 
With these dual aims in mind, the MACS system was conceived as a set of extremely durable shuttle craft components that could nevertheless be easily replicated and assembled as per mission requirements.

## Bumblebee Class

![Shuttlepod](images/macs/pod.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/macs/shuttlepod.stl)

Bumblebee class small shuttle

### Stats

 * Length: 6.4m
 * Width: 4.8m
 * Height: 2.3m
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 1
   * Maximum: 6
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 1.2
   * Maximum: Warp 2

### Description

The Bumblebee class shuttle is the foundation of the MACS program. Not only is it a stand alone shuttle, but it also acts as the cockpit/command module for every vehicle built on the MACS program.

### Structure

The Bumblebee is approximately the size of a Type 6 shuttlecraft and is used as replacement for the Type 6 on various ships (but not on the *Exodus*; we'll come to that later). Keeping in with the stated aims of the MACS program, it has much better armor and can take enough punishment to destroy the Type 6 ten times over. 

Also in keeping with the modularity aim of MACS, apart from the two seats for pilot and co-pilot, all parts of the Bumblebee's interior can be swapped out. Right behind the cockpit area are two alcoves to the side which can be configured as replicators, weapons lockers, lavatories or just plain exits - the last one being particularly useful when the standard exit of the shuttle (at the rear) is blocked by additional modules.

The rear half of the shuttle can be configured as seating/bunks (as in the Type 6), dense passenger seating, or additional consoles.

### Deployment

On the *Exodus* the *Bumblebee* is not used as a shuttle, but is kept on inventory for other MACS spacecraft, and as auxillary vehicles for smaller craft.

## Wasp Class

![Shuttle](images/macs/shuttle.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/macs/shuttle.stl)

Wasp class medium shuttle

### Stats

 * Length: 12.6m
 * Width: 9.4m
 * Height: 2.9m
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 1
   * Maximum: 6
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 3
   * Maximum: Warp 5
   
### Description

The *Wasp* class is a medium shuttle and standard inventory for light and medium cruisers in starfleet.

### Structure

The *Wasp* class adds a MACS small warp harness to the *Bumblebee*

![Small Warp Harness](images/macs/small-warp-harness.png)

The warp harness adds a bigger warp engine, and additonal components like extra phasers and a micro torpedo launcher.

From the interiors, the warp harness adds another replicator and a transporter alcove. There's a console to access the second warp core as well.

### Deployment

The *Wasp* class is not used as a standard auxillary vehicle on the *Exodus*, nor is it maintained as inventory. However, since the components are in inventory, as *Wasp* class can be assembled if needed within minutes.

## Hornet class

![Small Runabout](images/macs/small-runabout.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/macs/small-runabout.stl)

Hornet class heavy shuttle

### Stats

 * Length: 20.6m
 * Width: 9.4m
 * Height: 2.9m
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 1
   * Maximum: 14
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 2.1
   * Maximum: Warp 3.5

### Description

The *Hornet* class is a heavy shuttle more than 20m long, and is used as heavy shuttle on heavy and medium cruisers, and as a runabout on light cruisers.

### Structure

The *Hornet* class extends the *Wasp* by adding a MACS standard connector section in between.

![Extension](images/macs/extension.png)

The connector section contains 4 bunk beds, a replicator, and a lavatory. It also contains an extra computer core.

However the most important function of the connector section is that it connects the MACS components to its front and its back - and also any component that might be fixed below, by means of collapsible stairs.

In case the *Hornet* is used as a runabout, the bunk beds can be swapped out for science stations as required.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* maintains an inventory of 20 *Hornet* shuttles, and uses them to transfer cargo and personnel between stations. The *Hornet* is not used for planetary or space missions except in extreme circumstances.

## Dragonfly Class

![Cutter](images/macs/cutter.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/macs/cutter.stl)

Dragonfly class heavy shuttle/cutter

### Stats

 * Length: 32.5m
 * Width: 26.5m
 * Height: 5.5m
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 2
   * Maximum: 8
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 5
   * Maximum: Warp 9

### Description

The *Dragonfly* is a small ship with a large engine. It is used as a fast courier/cutter to gain the speed of the large warp core, and is used as a tug to utilize its powerful engine.

But the most common use is to attach it to one of the MACS cargo section and use it to haul cargo.

### Structure

The *Dragonfly* attaches a MACS large warp harness to the *Bumblebee*

![Large Warp Harness](images/macs/large-warp-harness.png)

The large warp harness delivers a warp core powerful enough for a large yacht or a small starship. 

From the interiors it adds a lavatory, replicator, transporter alcove, a computer core and an engineering console.

### Deployment

On the *Exodus*, section 4 (auxillary engineering) maintains 4 *Dragonflies* used as tug vessels.

## Beetle Class

![Heavy Runabout](images/macs/heavy-runabout.png)

Beetle class heavy cargo shuttle/runabout

### Stats

 * Length: 40.5m
 * Width: 26.5m
 * Height: 6.5m
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 2
   * typical: 5
   * Maximum: 35
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 3.5
   * Maximum: Warp 6.2

### Description

The *Beetle* class is one of the ships that really demonstrate the power and viability of the MACS program. It's built out of the same conponents which are standard in the MACS program but it's a craft big enough to be a small starship.

### Structure

The *Beetle* class adds the MACS heavy cargo containers to what is essentially a *Dragonfly* with a MACS connector module.

![Box](images/macs/habitat.png)

The cargo containers have independent gravity and environment systems, and can be configured to be habitable if needed. This makes the *Beetle* class not only a heavy cargo hauler, but also a heavy people hauler.

The Cargo containers can even be configured as scientific labs, and the *Beetle* class can be used as a heavy runabout, or a light science vessel.

The *Beetle* class is notorious for being used as a fast and cheap general purpose starship in remote Federation colonies.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* does not maintain an inventory of the *Beetle* class, although it can be assembled on demand to haul cargo. 

## Nightingale Class

![Hospital Ship](images/macs/hospital.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/macs/hospital.stl)

Nightingale Class Heavy Medevac Runabout

### Stats

 * Length: 46m
 * Width: 32m
 * Height: 8.4
 * Decks: 2
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 4
   * Typical: 10
   * Maximum: 75
 * Auxillary Craft: 1 *Bumblebee* class light shuttle
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 2.3
   * Maximum: Warp 5
   
### Description

The *Nightingale* is not a true member of the MACS family, although it is built from the standard MACS components. It was built specifically as a medevac vehicle for the *Exodus*, although it has since found use in a variety of ships and stations.

### Structure

The *Nightingale* complements what is the shuttle part of a *Beetle* class with a custom medical habitat:

![Disk](images/macs/disk.png)

Apart from containing independent gravity and environment controls, the disk also contains

  * The latest of medical equipment and scanners
  * Up to 20 isolated patient beds
  * Medical transporters with highly sensitive biofilters
  * Holo-emitters spanning the entire breadth of the disk capable of projecting 6 independent EMH

Even though the *Nightingale* is supposed to just carry patients from affected areas to the main hospital decks of the *Exodus*, the *Nightingale* by itself acts as a fully capable small hospital.

Regarding the ship itself, there's a second MACS *Bumblebee* module attached to the rear of the large warp harness. This can be used as a secondary command module, and given that it has been configured to detach and re-attach to the harness without requiring an engineering team, can also be used as an auxillary vehicle for the *Nightingale* itself.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* carries 2 *Nightingale* vessels in the lower hangars of section 1.

# ICP

The Intermediate Craft Program (ICP) began with the following observations:

 * Starships are getting larger and larger. Starships exceeding a kilometer in length are becoming the norm.
 * As a consequence of this, the capacity of starships to carry auxillary vehicles is also increasing.
 * Consequently, auxillary vehicles are becoming larger
 * Due to miniaturization and march of technology, any ship is more powerful than a previous generation's ship of comparable size.

The ICP was started to come up with craft in the 25m to 100m range, which is too large to be a shuttle but too small to be a starship. The ICP designed vehicles should be able to be used as standalone starships or as auxillary vehicles aboard starbases and large starships.

## Magpie Class

![Science Ship](images/icp/runabout.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/icp/runabout.stl)

Magpie Class Scientific Heavy Runabout

### Stats

 * Length: 22m
 * Width: 13.9m
 * Height: 5.1m
 * Decks: 1.5
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 1
   * Typical: 5
   * Maximum: 100
 * Auxillary Craft: *See note below*
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 4
   * Maximum: Warp 8.5

### Description

The *Magpie* is nominally the size of a regular runabout, but because of its boxy build manages to fit twice as much capacity as a regular runabout of its size. 

### Structure

The cockpit is in the front which contains the main consoles, transporter and replicator. The cockpit ends in a stair ascending half a deck to the rest of the ship. This contains the modular units of a runabout towards the sides, and towards the center there's an open area containing a messhall and an assembly area. Aft of that, is the cargo hold, which spans the height of two decks. 

Descending down into the cargo hold, we see the doors connecting to the half second deck underneath the main deck. The center of this is occupied by a horizontal warp core, with additional modular units on the sides. 

#### Note on auxillary vehicles

The cargo hold of the *Magpie* is big enough to hold land vehicle - or even a small shuttle although it would be a tight fit. To facilitate this, the cargo bay of the *Magpie* is equipped with semi-permeable shields.

### Deployment

The *Magpie* is the standard auxillary vehicle of the *Exodus*. It is used for planetary and deep space away missions, and used as transport vehicle for personnel and cargo. The *Exodus* maintains 80 *Magpie* vessels, distributed across all science sections.

## Hawk Class

![Tactical Runabout](images/icp/tactical-shuttle.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/icp/tactical-runabout.stl)

Hawk Class tactical runabout

### Stats

 * Length: 34.5m
 * Width: 21.8m
 * Height: 4.6m
 * Decks: 1
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 1
   * Typical: 2
   * Maximum: 50
 * Auxillary Craft: None
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 5.2
   * Maximum: Warp 8.7

### Description

The *Hawk* class is basically a *Magpie* with a bigger warp core, bigger warp coils, and more weapons. This reduces the capacity of the *Hawk* class to something slightly less than a standard runabout, but that doesn't really matter in practice since this class of vessels is generally used for tactical missions rather than scientific. 

### Structure

The combat capabilities of the *Hawk* class is comparable to dedicated fighters like the *Peregrine* and the *Valkyirie*, but unlike those, the *Hawk* class is a true runabout from the inside; apart from the command section and cockpit, the *Hawk* class also contains 4 rooms and a rear cargo hold like a standard runabout.

### Deployment

Typical deployments for the *Hawk* class are aboard starbases and large starships, where they supplement or replace dedicated fighter craft. Unlike warp fighters, which have a typical range of a few hundred million KM, *Hawk* class vessels can escort craft over several star systems.

The *Exodus* maintains an inventory of 30 *Hawk* class vessels in the upper shuttlebays of sections 7, 8 and 9. They are used as first response ship defence fighters, and as escort vessels for planetary missions.
 
## Raven Class

![Science Ship](images/icp/science.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/icp/science.stl)

Raven Class Scientific Heavy Runabout

### Stats

 * Length:51m 
 * Width: 40m
 * Height: 14m
 * Decks: 3
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 2
   * Typical: 10
   * Maximum: 200
 * Auxillary Craft: *Bumblebee* class shuttle
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 4
   * Maximum: Warp 8.5

### Description

The *Raven* is the first vessel created by the ICP which successfully acts as an independent ship as well as an auxillary vehicle. It is feature par with any science vessel from the pioneering age of warp travel, from the late 2100s to the early 2200s.

### Structure

The *Raven* has a very simple structure of single saucer shaped hull with warp coils at the bottom - somewhat like the ubiquitious *Miranda* class but much smaller.

Like all ships of the ICP, the *Raven* lacks a true bridge, which is replaced by the large cockpit at the front of deck 2. This is followed by runabout like modular labs and living area - messhall, sickbay, etc. This is followed by the engine room which houses the vertical warp core which occupies both decks. This is followed by the cargo/shuttle bay, which also houses the ship's transporters. The cargo bay also spans both decks.

The front part of deck 1 has additional labs which require specialized instrumentation.

#### Auxillary vehicles.

The large aft cargo bay of the *Raven* is large enough to hold small to medium shuttles and frequently carries 1 *Bumblebee* class shuttle.

### Deployment

The *Raven* is used by the *Exodus* like any other ship would use runabouts - stand alone missions, long missions, missions spanning multiple sites, etc. The *Exodus* maintains 16 *Raven* vessels, 2 in each science sections.

## Vulture Class

![Attack Ship](images/icp/attack.png)

Vulture Class Light Corvette/Patrol Vessel

### Stats

 * Length: 82m

 * Height: 15m
 * Decks: 3
 * Crew Capacity:
   * Minimum: 4
   * Typical: 12
   * Maximum: 56
 * Auxillary Craft: *Bumblebee* class shuttle
 * Warp Speed:
   * Cruising: Warp 7
   * Maximum: Warp 9.95

### Description

The *Vulture Class* is not just named after a bird of prey - for all practical purposes it is a Bird of Prey built to Star Fleet specifications.

The *Vulture* is arguably the most successful space craft built by the ICP. With a destructive power comparable to the *Constitution* class of about two centuries ago, the *Vulture* is deployed in a variety of patrol and escort roles. Within Federation space, the *Vulture* forms the first response to any threat. 

The *Vulture* can limp back from damage that would destroy much larger ships and with that it is fast developing a reputation of being the last response required as well.

### Structure

Like the *Hawk* is a *Magpie* with teeth, so is the *Vulture* a much better armed *Raven* class.

The *Vulture* contains a saucer section and a secondary hull but they're both fused together. The Warp nacelles are attached directly to the saucer section instead of being attached by pylons.

The upper deck is essentially a runabout, with the cockpit in front followed by main transporter and replicator, dormitory, sickbay, gym and brig. The aft part of the upper deck is a small cargo bay, which extends to an upper "attic" section above the main deck 1. This cargo section is directly connected to the torpedo launchers and can be used to hold extra torpedoes, or can be configured with a sensor array if required.

Deck 2 consists of engineering, with the deflector in front, the warp core and antimatter reserve extending almost the entire length of deck 2.

The saucer section is bigger than the interiors would indicate - and the extra space is occupied by a massive phaser array and auxillary antimatter reserve.

The warp core of the *Vulture* is much more powerful than a ship of this size would indicate, and even at it's top speed of Warp 9.95 it consumes only 25% of the power output. The overpowered warp core is mainly used to power the phaser array, which is what enables the *Vulture* to take out ships several times its size without breaking a sweat.

#### Note

The cargo hold of the *Vulture* can also hold a *Bumblebee* class shuttle. However it rarely carries one due to mission profiles never needing (relatively) delicate shuttles.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* contains two squadrons of 3 *Vulture* ships each. These are contained in the lower hangars of sections 8 and 9.

The *Vulture*s are used to escort the *Exodus* in flight through troubled space, and patrol the ship from a few AUs away when the ship drops to impulse. The *Vulture* is not used as a first response ship, since the massive warp core of the *Vulture* takes too long to power up from rest. 

## Eagle Class

### Description

The *Eagle* is a bird of prey but it is also a curious bird. Accordingly this class of ships has better defences and offences than a *Magpie*, and better sensors than a *Vulture*.

Unlike the other ships on this page, the *Eagle* is not used as a member of the *Exodus* "fleet". The *Eagle* is meant to carry out independent missions, and only uses the *Exodus* for its transwarp engine.

### Structure

The *Eagle* has a classic "starship" structure, with saucer shaped primary hull, secondary hull and warp nacelles.

Deck 1 contains various labs, dormitories, sickbay and messhall. The front of the primary hull contains the primary deflector, and an observation lounge behind it.

The secondary hull contains the warp core spanning three decks. The rear of the secondary hull contains a shuttlebay which holds two small shuttles.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* can carry upto 4 *Eagle* vessels in the lower hangars of sections 3, 5, 11 and 13. These ships will have independent survey or exploration missions and will use the *Exodus* for its transwarp engine.

If these hangars are empty, they're used to store the *Vulture* class ships, which can get awfully crowded in hangars 7 & 9.

### Description

Sometimes the *Eager* class is too overpowered for missions that require a Captain's yacht or a diplomatic vessel. For these occasions, we have the *dove* class

### Structure

Even though it resembles a starship with its structure of saucer - secondary hull - warp nacelle design, the *Dove* is actually a very large yacht.

The Saucer section contains the cockpit and main deflector at the front, followed by a circular corridor surrounding a pantry area to exit into the engineering room aft. The outer side of the corridor has 4 luxury rooms, two on either side.

The engineering section contains the main warp core and transporters.

### Deployment

The *Exodus* holds 3 *Dove* class yachts in the lower hangar of section 0.
