Star Trek type starships

## Mothership

![Mother Ship](mothership.png)

 * Length: 1500m
 * Width: 800m
 * Height: 220m
 * Decks: 30
   * Saucer Section: 8 decks (+ 60m tall hangar)
   * Sphere Section: 30 decks
   * Engine Section: 22 decks

At almost a kilometer and a half long, the *Exodus Class* is an incredible 
behemoth. Equipped with transwarp engines, The *Exodus* is meant to 
transport daughter ships to another quadrant - or even beyong the Galaxy
and act as a starship, starbase and fleet HQ all in one.

The 800m wide saucer section is bigger than the biggest ships so far by
itself, and is split into 16 sectors, each sector containing a massive
hangar in the lower section and livable area in the upper section. All in 
all it's big enough to be a city by itself.

The *Exodus Class* cruises at a sedate warp 6, and can move at warp 7 
when the engine is at maximum warp; which it never will be since the 
primary mode of propulsion for this juggernaut is transwarp.

The *Exodus Class* isn't going to win any beauty contest - nor for that
matter any races at warp - but it does a job no other ship can do.
